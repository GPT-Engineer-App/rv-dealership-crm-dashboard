# rv-dealership-crm-dashboard

I'm building a CRM for an RV dealership. Here's the CSS code snippet for my UI theme:

```css
/* Main UI colors */
:root {
 --burnt-orange: #CC5500;
 --deep-blue: #003366;
 --aluminum: #A9ACB6;
 --carbon-fiber-simulated: #333333; /* Simulated carbon fiber color */
}

/* ... add more styles as needed ... */

Let's start with the dashboard, the main screen of my CRM.  I want it to be visually appealing.  Here are some styling ideas:

Main Background: Use the --deep-blue color.
Cards or Panels: Sections with a lighter background color (consider variations of gray or subtle gradients).
Emphasis: Use --burnt-orange for important stats or call-to-action buttons.
Could you please provide React code using Chakra UI components for a basic dashboard layout?  For now, include:

Space for Key Stats: An area to display a few important metrics (e.g., new leads, conversion rate).
Leads Section: A placeholder where I'll later integrate my Leads table. "
